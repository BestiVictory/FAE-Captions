# FAE-Captions-Dataset
In this project, we collected the data on the flickr website to form the FAE-CAPTIONS dataset, and used two sets of models to compare the effect of the image caption task, proving that semi-supervised training is effective for this set of workflows in the field of lack of datasets. Effects are available.
